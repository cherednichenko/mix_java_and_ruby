# Installing and setting up

In this area I'll explain in details what should be installed to have ability to run and how.

  TBD

# Explanation of ideas this framework

The idea is to have ability to operate with different functions in .jars or in the Java based application by creating functions on the both Ruby and Java language.
It might give us the opportunity to keep all our Requirements (as Acceptance Criterias) inside our Test Framework + to run all of them in one click.
Deep sense is to obtain 'One Click Deployment' which can let us to build something really solid using Continuos Integration / Continuos Delivery more sufficient.

In two words - you have ability to call Ruby functions by using JRuby which is existed on top of Java.

  I'll describe a bit more later (TBD).

# Result of running

The result of running this framework could be seen by watching '/mix_java_and_ruby/features/support/logs/Result_running.mp4' movie.
It also could be reviewed by seeing '/mix_java_and_ruby/features/support/logs/Result.png' screenshot.

# Note

It's a preliminary stuff done and don't strictly look at opening browser as it's just for demonstration of GSon function which sends info to it.
In real Java application you don't need to work with the browser object at all.
