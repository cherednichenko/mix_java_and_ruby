# Training

I try to combine running/calling Java and Ruby functions within the same framework.

# Source of thoughts

The idea and training were taken from this repo - https://github.com/machzqcq/Training-JRuby and from this site - http://www.seleniumframework.com/java-and-ruby/mix-java-and-ruby/


p.s. many thanks for examples.
